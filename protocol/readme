This application will send files between two wireless modems. The application will be using the (Be Creative) Protocol to send data. This will mean this program will be able to send and recieve files from other programs using this protocol too. The packets used in this program will be checked with CRC 16 and will be fully event driven.

Statistics will be stored as packets are sent/recieved.

The statistics are:
	Protocol efficiency
	Effective bits per second
	Number of packets sent/recieved
	Number of ACKs sent/recieved
	Number of NAKs sent/recieved
	Number of ENQs sent/recieved
	Bits sent/recieved
	Bit error rate
	Response time (lag)
	Total file transfer time
	Number of timeouts
	Average amount of padding in each packet
	Packets sent/recieved per second
